We have 3 apps in this folder, developed as seperate part of 1 user story line, could be combined in future:

* ViroSample, this contains the augmented reality component
* FaceSpotter-starter, this contains the facial recognition code
* ARYouKittenMe2 - app to help guide users to a building entrance

We uesd Googles facial recognition API, android and IOS native AR functionality. Written in xamerin, react native and Java to test concepts accross tech stacks.

Possibilities to extend in inside navigation, i.e. guide me to meeting rooms.
Also can do bio pop up's with other things, i.e. Car number plates, useful in harpenden to find whos car it is etc!

lots of AR possibilities, this suite of products was aimed to test, learn and give a taste of what is possible!
